### Reporting issues

By default, issues are disabled for individual OCDS extensions. Instead, there is a [ocds extension repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/) to gather issues for all extensions in a single place.

If you have an issue to report, please submit it there. Make sure you indicate the appropriate extension following this format in the title: **_extension_name: issue title_**.
