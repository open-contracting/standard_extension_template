# OCDS Extension Template

To learn more about extensions to the Open Contracting Data Standard, read the relevant page in the [Extension Explorer](https://extensions.open-contracting.org/en/publishers/) and [OCDS documentation](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/extensions/).

To use this template:

1. [Download the template as a ZIP file](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_extension_template/archive/master.zip)
1. Extract it, change to its directory, and initialize a git repository (`git init`)
1. Update the files, as needed
1. Delete any files you have not changed
1. Commit the files you have changed
1. Push your commit to a new, public git repository
1. Register the extension in the [Extension Registry](https://github.com/open-contracting/extension_registry)

(Use of git for version control is recommended, but not required. Extensions can be hosted on any public HTTP server, providing the file structure matches that in this template repository.)
